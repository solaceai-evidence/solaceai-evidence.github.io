            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>SOLACE-AI is a project aiming to create real-time evidence synthesis
            to support policy and humanitarian responses to climate-change health
            emergencies. Our team will co-create the system with policy makers,
            humanitarian organizations, experts in evidence synthesis, and impacted
            populations, including those in countries most affected by climate
            change.</p>
            <p>SOLACE-AI will be built on top of new technologies which we will
            create and evaluate. The system will consider scientific literature, as
            well as critical non-research documents such as humanitarian reports,
            policy guidelines, impact assessments, and local case studies. We will
            closely follow best practices in scientific evidence synthesis and
            rigorously evaluate the accuracy of system components. The system will
            be evaluated in six diverse case studies—concrete, urgent problems which
            our collaborators are facing globally.</p>

            <p>Our aim is to drastically reduce the time, effort, and cost of
            producing evidence syntheses. The syntheses created by SOLACE-AI will be
            on-demand, always up-to-date, and could address problems, countries, and
            issues of health equity which have been too-often ignored. Getting
            high-quality evidence into the hands of those facing and dealing with
            climate health problems could lead to better decision-making and
            ultimately improve the lives of affected community residents.</p>
