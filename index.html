            <h5>About</h5>
            <p>SOLACE-AI is a project aiming to create real-time evidence synthesis
            to support policy and humanitarian responses to climate-change health
            emergencies. Our team will co-create the system with policy makers,
            humanitarian organizations, experts in evidence synthesis, and impacted
            populations, including those in countries most affected by climate
            change.</p>
            <p>SOLACE-AI will be built on top of new technologies which we will
            create and evaluate. The system will consider scientific literature, as
            well as critical non-research documents such as humanitarian reports,
            policy guidelines, impact assessments, and local case studies. We will
            closely follow best practices in scientific evidence synthesis and
            rigorously evaluate the accuracy of system components. The system will
            be evaluated in six diverse case studies—concrete, urgent problems which
            our collaborators are facing globally.</p>

            <p>We will design, deploy, and evaluate the system through six global
              case studies (see <a href="#casestudy-table">Table</a>)—examples of
              the diverse question types that SOLACE-AI will address—and rigorously
              evaluate its outputs to determine its fitness-for-use.</p>

            <p>Our aim is to drastically reduce the time, effort, and cost of
            producing evidence syntheses. The syntheses created by SOLACE-AI will be
            on-demand, always up-to-date, and could address problems, countries, and
            issues of health equity which have been too-often ignored. Getting
            high-quality evidence into the hands of those facing and dealing with
            climate health problems could lead to better decision-making and
            ultimately improve the lives of affected community residents.</p>

        <section id="our-approach">
          <h5>Our Approach</h5>
<p>The research is structured in five workstreams running throughout the
project. In Workstream 1, we will engage with users to co-design the
system. Workstreams 2–4 will develop and test the new computational
methods needed to conduct automated research synthesis. We decompose
this task into: identifying relevant evidence (Workstream 2), developing
critically appraised summaries (Workstream 3), and synthesis (Workstream
4). Workstream 5 comprises rigorous assessment of scientific validity of
the components and the overall system, deployed in diverse case
studies. </p>
<p><strong>Workstream 1. Engagement and co-creation of the system with
global partners (Fairall/Pollitt)</strong></p>
<p>Problem statement: Low-and-middle-income countries disproportionately
experience the impacts of climate change. It is critical to work with
populations, policy makers, humanitarian and health professionals living
and working in affected areas to maximise the impact of SOLACE-AI.</p>
<p>Aims: We will co-create SOLACE-AI with diverse stakeholders living
and working in areas affected by climate change to ensure it addresses
their needs. </p>
<p>Approach: We will convene a wide group of experts in climate,
evidence synthesis, policy, humanitarian aid, healthcare, and members of
the public affected by climate change. This stakeholder group will be
diverse in expertise, experience, and location. We will use a
transdisciplinary community-based
participatory research (CBPR) approach, recognised as a more equitable
methodology for involving communities most impacted by climate change.  We will
engage with this group regularly through workshops, regular contact via
email/phone calls, and smaller-group online meetings. Members will
provide critical oversight of the project: informing methods,
evaluation, and system design; providing expertise and local knowledge.
We will use participatory design activities, such as storyboarding, and
low-fidelity prototypes to co-design the system. The stakeholder group
will define six case studies: examples of urgent problems faced by
specific communities. These case studies will provide a focus for both
the design of SOLACE-AI and its real-world evaluation (in Workstream
5).</p>

<td><em>Example case study: Addressing mental health and substance abuse
problems in populations affected by climate change in
Ethiopia</em><br><br>The Somali region of eastern Ethiopia has a long
history of nomadic pastoral living, a traditional way of life for
millions, rearing camels, cattle, sheep, and goats on natural
grasslands. Since the 1950s, extreme weather events since have caused
devastating droughts and flash-floods. Increased food and water
insecurity, disease outbreaks, lost livelihoods, forced migration,
conflicts, and the loss of valued landscapes due to climate change have
led to escalating mental health problems, including suicide and
substance abuse. Yet mental health services in the Somali region of
Ethiopia are woefully inadequate. In this case study we will investigate
whether SOLACE-AI could support evidence-based responses to this
crisis.</td>

<p>To maximise policy impact, we will hold two Policy Labs (month six in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; and year two online). Policy Labs,
pioneered by King’s Policy Institute bring together key decision makers,
professionals, and the public to tackle practical questions to inform
policy and practice; based around day-long structured workshops. We have
adapted and conducted Labs in low- and middle-income settings. Topics
will be selected with stakeholder input to reflect local context,
cultures, and priorities; and might include, e.g. issues of trust,
health equity, and quality assurance for AI systems to inform climate
emergencies. Through follow-on activities—e.g., implementation
workshops—we will generate lasting investment by participants,
developing a valuable network of advisors and champions to support
development and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Workstream 2. Methods for automatically identifying evidence
needed to address climate health problems
(Wallace/Marshall)</strong></p>
<p>Problem statement: The evidence needed to address climate health
impacts is overwhelming, and new publications accumulate daily. Existing
interfaces to the literature are based predominantly on keyword search,
but this is inadequate to facilitate efficient evidence retrieval and
synthesis.</p>
<p>Aims: We will develop new LLM-based methods to identify comprehensive
collections of documents which address natural language questions on
climate-health problems. </p>
<p>Approach: Evidence syntheses require a comprehensive, unbiased set of
all evidence addressing a particular question. Rather than
relying on traditional information retrieval methods that search over
unstructured texts, we propose to investigate novel zero-shot neural
information retrieval methods for identifying all relevant evidence that
will also surface the specific passages or snippets justifying its
relevance. While there is a large body of work on semi-automated
abstract screening—including by
the applicants—modern
LLMs offer the enticing possibility of dramatically more efficient
systems for this task, given their well-documented zero-/few-shot
capabilities;
this may support culling the entire set of studies relevant to an
arbitrary query without manually screening a subset, i.e., on-demand and
fully automatically.</p>
<p>Our partners need syntheses to incorporate diverse scientific and
humanitarian reports, impact evaluations, policy documents, national and
international guidelines, and local geographical/social/political
knowledge. We will therefore consider documents including from OpenAlex,
World Bank, WHO scorecards/factsheets, GBDCompare, the 3ie development
portal, and ReliefWeb; final data sources will be selected in Workstream
1. We will create evaluation datasets based on diverse systematic
reviews in the WHO Repository of Systematic Reviews on Interventions in
Environment, Climate Change and Health (created by Shrikhande); and the
IRC’s review collection.</p>
<p>“Classic” approaches to retrieval use keyword-based representations
of documents which are unlikely to capture subtle aspects of study
eligibility (e.g., components of complex interventions). Modern LLMs can
provide free-text rationales—which the applicants have worked on
extensively—and will
allow us to consider full-text articles, providing the detail needed to
make inclusion/exclusion decisions.</p>
<p>As a baseline approach we will evaluate zero-shot GPT models.
However, we prefer to not depend upon OpenAI models, which are
closed-source, black-box, and can be modified unpredictably over time.
Therefore, we will combine rationales provided by GPT with reference
relevance labels from the training set to teach Mistral-Instruct (or
similar) to provide explanations. We will also investigate ranking
evidence reports, according to the probabilities assigned by the LLM to
tokens indicating that a study should be included. This will permit
direct comparison between DPR and LLM-based methods. We will then
experiment with eliciting reasons for exclusion to allow users to verify
automated decisions. </p>
<p><strong>Workstream 3. Automated critical summaries of individual
evidence reports (Marshall/Wallace)</strong></p>
<p>Problem statement: LLMs are effective at summarising documents, but
they take author text at face value. But research synthesis requires
that evidence is critically appraised so that more weight is placed on
the highest quality research. </p>
<p>Aims: We will investigate LLM methods for producing critical
narrative summaries of individual studies considering the validity of
findings and health equity by creating LLM modules which explicitly
perform distinct sub-tasks of rigorous evidence synthesis.</p>
<p>Approach: We will co-design semi-structured extraction templates for
diverse evidence reports, with stakeholders (Workstream 1), and the
Brown and IRC teams. These will include information relating to methods,
setting, participants, interventions, and findings, and information
relevant to health equity (PROGRESS-Plus), and quality
assessment. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we will conditionally extract
(or infer) narratives describing these fields from evidence reports.</p>
<p>This approach brings several benefits. First, by instantiating
different LLMs for each sub-task, we can capitalise on the strengths of
current generative AI without sacrificing the principles of formal,
rigorous evidence synthesis. Second, a modular approach yields
intermediate outputs (e.g., structured results, quality assessments)
which can be inspected, providing a verification mechanism. Third, this
modular approach means that we can rapidly incorporate new LLMs as they
emerge—crucial given the fast-changing landscape.</p>
<p>We will evaluate zero- and few-shot approaches for very large models,
and fine-tuning methods for smaller LMs. We will explore methods for
abstaining from providing findings in cases of low certainty. Based on
the need for mixed-methods synthesis for climate-health topics, our
starting point for development of this module, will be the MMAT (2018)
tool; which
provides a framework for quality assessment for qualitative, randomised
controlled, non-randomised, quantitative descriptive, and mixed methods
research. We will supplement the MMAT with the 3ie tool for systematic
reviews, and
consider additional quality measures based on input from Workstream
1.</p>
<p>We have previously defined logistic regression and Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) models for risk of bias assessment in randomised trials. Here we will
adopt an LLM (such as Mistral), and treat risk of bias prediction as a
text-to-text problem for each quality prompt, generating (a) an
assessment (yes/no/can’t tell) and (b) a rationale supporting this. </p>
<p><strong>Workstream 4. Automated, scientifically robust, synthesis
(Marshall/Mishra/Wallace)</strong></p>
<p>Problem statement: SOLACE-AI must synthesise evidence from published
and unpublished reports that align with user preferences and aggregate
the key semi-structured data from sources appropriately and
transparently. </p>
<p>Aims: We will design, implement, and evaluate novel strategies which
enable LLMs to generate rigorous overviews of article collections in
accordance with established principles of evidence synthesis. </p>
<p>Approach: To encourage models to generate meaningful syntheses of
evidence in its outputs, we will conditionally generate summaries on the
basis of the key elements extracted and inferred from outputs of modules
in the preceding workstream. We hypothesise that conditioning summary
generation in this way—combined with appropriate prompting and/or
fine-tuning—will yield meaningful synthesised narrative overviews of
evidence collections. </p>
<p>Current generation LLMs (e.g. GPT) do not reliably synthesise
findings across multiple documents. Here, we will
develop methods which aim to produce reports that are grounded in
critical appraisal of the underlying studies, and faithful to the
statistical results. This module will consume the outputs of the modules
from Workstream 2–3 and generate a narrative summary of the evidence on
the basis of these. We will work with stakeholders to understand their
information needs and wants in terms of narrative evidence overviews,
following our preliminary work. We will start
by simply conditioning the model on the extracted and inferred elements,
put together into a prompt and combined with instructions to aggregate.
Should simple prompting strategies prove insufficient, we will explore
structured decoding techniques for generation that attempt to
enforce fidelity to the inputs provided, and which may incorporate
explicit aggregation steps to put the given evidence together. We plan
to incorporate state-of-the-art machine learning translation approaches
(including emerging low-resource language LLMs) to provide
evidence in users’ local languages.</p>
<p><strong>Workstream 5. Evaluation of the methods
(Trikalinos/Shrikhande), and the final synthesis system
(Warfa/Abdulahi)</strong></p>
<p>Problem statement: We need to evaluate the utility of the new
technologies we develop, both in terms of scientific validity and in
their ability to impact policy, humanitarian responses, and affected
populations.</p>
<p>Aims: We will combine technologies developed in workstreams 2–4, to
provide real time analysis in response to queries. We will stress test
the system using tailored “red-teaming” methods, which have emerged as
best-practice for evaluating LLMs and the user-facing systems they
enable. We will deploy the system in the case studies (Workstream 1),
and evaluate the usability, accuracy, and usefulness of the outputs for
improving policy and humanitarian decision making in the real-world.</p>
<p>Approach: We will develop and apply red-team methods to evaluate the
scientific validity of our system’s outputs and to identify error
modes.
Red-teams are independent researchers tasked with adversarially probing
a system for errors or vulnerabilities. Red-teaming has been used to
identify prompts which would cause LLMs such as ChatGPT to generate
harmful or offensive content, and updated models to prevent such
behaviour. A
team led by Trikalinos, with input on climate/humanitarian synthesis
methods (Shrikhande/Mishra) will apply these principles to validate our
system, scrutinising intermediate steps and final outputs. Problems will
be addressed through improvements to the methods in Workstreams 2–4,
and/or making changes to the output displays (e.g., presenting
caveats/warnings).</p>
<p>Warfa and Abdulahi will lead the evaluation of the deployed system.
Our goal is to move beyond assessments of accuracy and consider the
potential of the system to translate to action for impacted communities,
policymakers, and other stakeholders. Partners leading each of the six
case studies developed in Workstream 1 will convene community evaluation
groups; including policy makers, humanitarian practitioners, health
workers, and members of the affected populations. In CBPR, community
members provide critical oversight on the research; and participate
actively in defining research questions, and evaluation methods. We will
use local facilitators, to enable people to participate in their local
language(s). We collaborate with communities to define qualitative and
quantitative evaluation methods; which seek to understand the utility of
the system in practice, and understand and overcome barriers to
impact.</p>
